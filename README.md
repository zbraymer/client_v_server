# client v. server
Overwatch Homework Part2

Homework Prompt: 
    In the language of your choice, create two programs ("Client" and "Server") that communicate with each other. Client should send text input by the user to Server.        Server should echo the received text in all capital letters.  Client should display the echoed text.  Additionally, Server should notify Client of the current time once a minute.  Client should display the received time.  Feel free to use third party libraries.  Client and Server may run on the same computer.
    
    
    
# Usage
To use this application, open two terminal windows, navigate to the repository root in each. In the first terminal run server.py, (python server.py) and in the second terminal run client.py (python client.py).  You can run this application in any python environment, as it only imports from the standard library.

To exit the application, type `exit` in the client terminal.  If it hangs, as always `CRTL+C` works.
